# Amityn MVP â€“ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for **Amityn**, an MVP social platform designed to foster **authentic friendships** and **community connection** through shared passions, interests, and values. This SRS specifies the functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and design principles guiding development.

### 1.2 Scope

Amityn MVP will provide:

- Public user profiles with core information
- Interest-based discovery and search
- Geolocation-based browsing (city / postal code prefix)
- A clean, welcoming interface for browsing and reading profiles

Amityn does **not** (in the MVP) include in-app messaging or events. These features may be introduced in post-MVP iterations.

### 1.3 Definitions

- **User**: A registered account holder on Amityn.
- **Profile**: The public-facing set of information about a user.
- **Interest**: A tagged passion, hobby, or value associated with a user's profile.
- **Discovery**: The browsing/searching process for finding others on Amityn.
- **Community (post-MVP)**: A user-created group centered around location, interests, or causes.
